            <h1 class="inline">Trash Sundays </h1>is a community-driven initiative that encourages
            individuals and groups to come together every Sunday to pick up
            trash in their local environments. It’s more than just cleaning up
            our surroundings; it’s about fostering a sense of community,
            connecting with nature, and ending the week with a tangible
            accomplishment that benefits everyone.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Our mission is simple: to reduce litter, one Sunday at a time. We believe
      that small actions, when multiplied by many, can transform our world.
      Trash Sundays is not just an initiative; it’s a movement toward a cleaner,
      more connected, and more mindful world.

    <h2>How is Trash Sundays Different?</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Unlike many apps that promote passive consumption, Trash Sundays
      encourages active participation. Instead of losing hours scrolling through
      social media, use that time to engage in a meaningful, hands-on activity
      that makes a positive impact. It’s about breaking the cycle of mindless
      consumption and replacing it with purposeful action.
